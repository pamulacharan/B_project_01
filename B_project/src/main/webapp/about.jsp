	<p>Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expressions in the
		same way that they are used in algebra. The following table lists the
		arithmetic operators:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="">Addition</a></li>
		<li><a href="">Subtraction (also unary minus)</a></li>
		<li><a href="">Multiplication</a></li>
		<li><a href="">Division</a></li>
		<li><a href="">Modulus</a></li>
	</ul>
	<article>All behave as you would expect for all numeric
		types. The minus operator also has a unary form that negates its
		single operand. Remember that when the division operator is applied to
		an integer type, there will be no fractional component attached to the
		result. The following simple example program demonstrates the
		arithmetic operators. It also illustrates the difference between
		floating-point division and integer division. The modulus operator, %,
		returns the remainder of a division operation. It can be applied to
		floating point types as well as integer types. The following example
		program demonstrates the %: Java provides special operators that can
		be used to combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment. As you
		probably know, statements like the following are quite common in
		programming: a = a + 4; In Java, you can rewrite this statement as
		shown here: a += 4; This version uses the += compound assignment
		operator. Both statements perform the same action: they increase the
		value of a by 4. Here is another example, a = a % 2; which can be
		expressed as a %= 2; In this case, the %= obtains the remainder of a/2
		and puts that result back into a. There are compound assignment
		operators for all of the arithmetic, binary operators. Thus, any
		statement of the form var = var op expression; can be rewritten as var
		op= expression; The compound assignment operators provide two
		benefits. First, they save you a bit of typing, because they are
		shorthand for their equivalent long forms. Second, they are
		implemented more efficiently by the Java run time system than are
		their equivalent long forms.</article>
